<h3>Hearing aid compatibility (HAC)</h3>


<p>This phone is hearing aid compatible as determined by ANSI C63.19-2019, amended under the conditions of FCC limited waiver DA 23-914. The ANSI C63.19-2019 standard does not use the rating system that older versions of the standard used, i.e., M rating, which is a measure of immunity to radio frequency interference for acoustic coupling hearing aids, and T rating, which is a measure of performance when used with an inductive coupling (telecoil) hearing aid. Specifically, the 2019 ANSI Standard requires that handsets meet volume control specifications in order to be considered hearing aid-compatible under that standard. Under the waiver, certain Volume Control test requirements are relaxed or waived and certain test configurations were partially or not tested. For instance, only Commercial Mobile Radio Services (CMRS) narrowband and CMRS wideband voice codecs are required to comply with the volume control requirements of the Volume Control Standard. All other codecs, such as full-band and super-wideband codecs or over-the-top (OTT) codecs, are not required to comply with the Volume Control Standard. In order to pass the volume control requirement, a handset must meet a two-part test. The first part of the requirement tests for conversational gain with a hearing aid, and the second part of the requirement tests for conversational gain without a hearing aid. To pass both parts of the requirement, a handset must have at least 6 dB of conversational gain with or without a hearing aid.</p>


<p>This phone has been evaluated and meets the volume control requirements per technical specification ANSI C63.19-2019 and under FCC limited waiver DA 23-914.The actual conversational gain for fully tested Enhanced Voice Services (EVS) narrowband and EVS wideband codecs and air interface combinations is 17.1 dB with hearing aids and 18.6 dB without hearing aids. The lowest conversational gain for partially tested Enhanced Full Rate (EFR), Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) narrowband, and AMR wideband codecs and air interface combinations is 18.7 dB with hearing aids and 18.5 dB without hearing aids.</p>


<p>This phone has been tested and certified for use with hearing aids for some of the wireless technologies that they use. However, there may be some newer wireless technologies used in this phone that have not been tested yet for use with hearing aids. It is important to try the different features of your phone thoroughly and in different locations, using your hearing aid or cochlear implant, to determine if you hear any interfering noise. Consult your service provider or Google for information on hearing aid compatibility. If you have questions about return or exchange policies, consult your service provider or phone retailer.</p>


<p>The table below shows the wireless technologies (including frequencies/bands by air interface and codec) that were tested or not tested according to FCC rules and limited waiver DA 23-914.</p>

<h4>स्पेसिफ़िक ऐब्ज़ॉर्पशन रेट (एसएआर) की जानकारी</h4>


<p>आपका डिवाइस एक रेडियो ट्रांसमीटर और रिसीवर है. यह इलेक्ट्रोमैग्नेटिक फ़ील्ड से इंसानी संपर्क की सुरक्षित माने जाने वाली सीमा को लेकर बनाए गए अंतरराष्ट्रीय दिशा-निर्देशों का पालन करता है. यह डिवाइस, रेडियो तरंगों से संपर्क के मामले पर भारत सरकार के दूरसंचार विभाग ("DoT") के बनाए गए दिशा-निर्देशों का पालन करता है. इन दिशा-निर्देशों में, संपर्क की सुरक्षित सीमा तय करने के लिए, स्पेसिफ़िक ऐब्ज़ॉर्पशन रेट (""एसएआर"") वैल्यू को आधार बनाया गया है. इस वैल्यू से यह पता चलता है कि डिवाइस का इस्तेमाल करते समय इंसान का शरीर कितनी मात्रा में रेडियो फ़्रीक्वेंसी सोख सकता है. भारत में मोबाइल फ़ोन के लिए, एसएआर की सीमा 1.6 वॉट/कि॰ग्रा॰ है. यह औसत मापी गई ऊर्जा को शरीर के एक ग्राम टिशू में फैलाकर निकाला गया है.</p>


<p>कान से सटाकर या शरीर से 10 मि॰मी॰ दूर रखकर इस्तेमाल किए जाने पर, यह फ़ोन इन दिशा-निर्देशों का पालन करता है. पक्का करें कि फ़ोन की ऐक्सेसरी, जैसे कि फ़ोन केस, फ़ोन होल्डर वगैरह धातु से बने हुए न हों. दूरी से जुड़ी ज़रूरी शर्तें पूरी करने के लिए, फ़ोन को अपने शरीर से सुरक्षित दूरी पर रखें.</p>


<p>इस डिवाइस के लिए, स्पेसिफ़िक ऐब्ज़ॉर्पशन रेट (एसएआर) की ज़्यादा से ज़्यादा वैल्यू, इन स्थितियों में इस तरह है:</p>


<ul>
  <li>सिर के पास होने पर: 1.06 वॉट/कि॰ग्रा॰,</li>
  <li>शरीर के पास होने पर: 0.93 वॉट/कि॰ग्रा॰.</li>
</ul>


<p>एसएआर की वैल्यू, DoT/ टेलीकम्यूनिकेशन इंजीनियरिंग सेंटर की वेबसाइट पर भी देखी जा सकती हैं.</p>


<p>लैब में की गई ज़्यादातर रिसर्च में यह साबित नहीं हो पाया है कि रेडियो फ़्रीक्वेंसी रेडिएशन के संपर्क में आने से स्वास्थ्य पर कोई असर पड़ता है. इसके बावजूद, DoT ने मोबाइल हैंडसेट का इस्तेमाल करते समय बचाव के लिए कुछ तरीके बताए हैं, जो यहां दिए गए हैं:</p>


<p>कम पावर वाले ब्लूटूथ वायरलेस हैंड्स-फ़्री डिवाइस (हेडफ़ोन, हेडसेट वगैरह) का इस्तेमाल करें. पक्का करें कि सेल फ़ोन की एसएआर कम हो. अपने कॉल को छोटा रखें या उसके बजाय मैसेज (एसएमएस) भेजें. यह सलाह खास तौर पर बच्चों, किशोरों, और गर्भवती महिलाओं के लिए है. सिग्नल अच्छे रहने पर ही सेल फ़ोन का इस्तेमाल करें. जिन लोगों के शरीर में पेसमेकर या अन्य मेडिकल डिवाइस लगे हैं उन्हें फ़ोन को इंप्लांट वाले हिस्से से कम से कम 15 सें॰मी॰ दूर रखना चाहिए.</p>


<p>इस डिवाइस पर, भारत में आपदा और अन्य खतरों की चेतावनी देने वाली सेल ब्रॉडकास्ट सेवा (सीबीएस) काम करती है. इसमें अलग-अलग तरह की चेतावनियां पाने की सुविधा को चालू या बंद किया जा सकता है और पिछली चेतावनियां देखी जा सकती हैं. साथ ही, चेतावनियां मिलने पर होने वाली आवाज़ और वाइब्रेशन को कंंट्रोल किया जा सकता है.</p>


<ol>
  <li>अपने डिवाइस पर सेटिंग ऐप्लिकेशन खोलें.</li>
  <li><strong>सूचनाएं</strong> <img alt="and then" src="image1.png" width="18" height="18"> <strong>खतरे की चेतावनी</strong> पर टैप करें.</li>
  <li>यह चुनें कि आपको चेतावनियां कब-कब मिलें और किन सेटिंग को चालू करना है.</li>

<p>भारत में इस लेबल का मतलब है कि इस फ़ोन को घर, दुकान, और फ़ैक्ट्री के कचरे के साथ नहीं फेंका जाना चाहिए. इसे सही जगह पर ले जाना चाहिए, ताकि इसमें से काम की चीज़ों को निकालकर उन्हें रीसाइकल किया जा सके.</p>


<p>Google यह एलान करता है कि आपका डिवाइस, ई-कचरा (मैनेजमेंट) नियम, 2022 (जिन्हें आगे "नियम" कहा जाएगा) के मुताबिक, बनाया और डिज़ाइन किया गया है. यह खास तौर से नियम 16 (1) के मुताबिक है, जिसमें इलेक्ट्रिकल और इलेक्ट्रॉनिक उपकरण को बनाने में खतरनाक चीज़ों का इस्तेमाल कम से कम करने के लिए कहा गया है. साथ ही, यह भी बताया गया है कि होमोजीनीयस मटीरियल (जिसे मशीन की मदद से रासायनिक रूप से एक से ज़्यादा मटीरियल के तौर पर अलग नहीं किया जा सकता) में इन खतरनाक चीज़ों की मात्रा कितनी होनी चाहिए. हालांकि, कुछ मामलों में छूट भी दी गई है, जिनके बारे में शेड्यूल II में बताया गया है.</p>


<p>ई-कचरे को गलत तरीके से हैंडल करने, उसे नष्ट करने, गलती से उसके टूट जाने, खराब हो जाने या गलत तरीके से रीसाइकल किए जाने से, कई तरह के खतरे हो सकते हैं. इनमें आग लगने, विस्फोट होने, और/या दूसरे तरह के खतरे शामिल हो सकते हैं. इसके अलावा, ई-कचरे को नियंत्रित तौर पर नष्ट न करने से पर्यावरण को नुकसान पहुंच सकता है. इनमें ऐसे नुकसान भी शामिल हैं जिनकी भरपाई नहीं की जा सकती. ऐसा तब होता है, जब नष्ट किए गए संसाधन दोबारा इस्तेमाल के लायक नहीं रह जाते. कुछ ई-कचरे में खतरनाक रसायन होते हैं जिन्हें गलत तरीके से नष्ट किए जाने पर पानी, मिट्टी, और दूसरे प्राकृतिक संसाधन ज़हरीले हो सकते हैं. इन्हें गलत तरीके से नष्ट किए जाने पर पौधों, जानवरों, और इंसानों को नुकसान पहुंच सकता है.</p>
