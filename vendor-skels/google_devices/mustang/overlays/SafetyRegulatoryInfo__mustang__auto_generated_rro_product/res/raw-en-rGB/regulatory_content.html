<h4>Hearing aid compatibility (HAC)</h4>


<p>This phone is hearing aid compatible as determined by ANSI C63.19-2019, amended under the conditions of FCC limited waiver DA 23-914. The ANSI C63.19-2019 standard does not use the rating system that older versions of the standard used, i.e. M rating, which is a measure of immunity to radio-frequency interference for acoustic coupling hearing aids, and T rating, which is a measure of performance when used with an inductive coupling (telecoil) hearing aid. Specifically, the 2019 ANSI standard requires that handsets meet volume control specifications in order to be considered hearing aid compatible under that standard. Under the waiver, certain volume control test requirements are relaxed or waived and certain test configurations were partially or not tested. For instance, only commercial mobile radio services (CMRS) narrowband and CMRS wideband voice codecs are required to comply with the volume control requirements of the Volume Control Standard. All other codecs, such as full-band and super-wideband codecs, or over-the-top (OTT) codecs, are not required to comply with the Volume Control Standard. In order to pass the volume control requirement, a handset must meet a two-part test. The first part of the requirement tests for conversational gain with a hearing aid and the second part of the requirement tests for conversational gain without a hearing aid. To pass both parts of the requirement, a handset must have at least 6 dB of conversational gain with or without a hearing aid.</p>


<p>Your phone has been evaluated and meets the volume control requirements per technical specification ANSI C63.19-2019 and under FCC limited waiver DA 23-914.</p>

<p>The actual conversational gain for fully-tested enhanced voice services (EVS) narrowband and EVS wideband codecs and air interface combinations is 17.2 dB with hearing aids and 19.9 dB without hearing aids. The lowest conversational gain for partially-tested enhanced full rate (EFR), adaptive multi-rate (AMR) narrowband, and AMR wideband codecs and air interface combinations is 16.6 dB with hearing aids and 19.3 dB without hearing aids.</p>


<p><strong>Pixel 10 Pro</strong></p>


<p>The actual conversational gain for fully-tested enhanced voice services (EVS) narrowband and EVS wideband codecs and air interface combinations is 16.8 dB with hearing aids and 18.6 dB without hearing aids. The lowest conversational gain for partially-tested enhanced full rate (EFR), adaptive multi-rate (AMR) narrowband, and AMR wideband codecs and air interface combinations is 16.7 dB with hearing aids and 17.3 dB without hearing aids.</p>


<p><strong>Pixel 10 Pro XL</strong></p>


<p>The actual conversational gain for fully-tested enhanced voice services (EVS) narrowband and EVS wideband codecs and air interface combinations is 17.2 dB with hearing aids and 19.3 dB without hearing aids. The lowest conversational gain for partially-tested enhanced full rate (EFR), adaptive multi-rate (AMR) narrowband, and AMR wideband codecs and air interface combinations is 16.9 dB with hearing aids and 19.1 dB without hearing aids.</p>


<p>Your phone has been tested and certified for use with hearing aids for some of the wireless technologies that they use. However, there may be some newer wireless technologies used in your phone that have not been tested yet for use with hearing aids. It is important to try the different features of your phone thoroughly and in different locations, using your hearing aid or cochlear implant, to determine if you hear any interfering noise. Consult your service provider or Google for information on hearing aid compatibility. If you have questions about return or exchange policies, consult your service provider or phone retailer.</p>


<p>The table below shows the wireless technologies (including frequencies/bands by air interface and codec) that were tested or not tested according to FCC rules and limited waiver DA 23-914.</p>

<h4>Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) information</h4>


<p>Your device is a radio transmitter and receiver. It complies with international guidelines in relation to the limiting of human exposure to electromagnetic fields and has been specifically designed to meet the guidelines for exposure to radio waves established by the Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Government of India ('DoT'). The guidelines use a unit of measurement known as Specific Absorption Rate ('SAR'), which is a unit of body-absorbed radio-frequency quantity when the device is in use. The SAR limit in India for mobile devices is 1.6 W/kg over a mass of 1 gram of human tissue.</p>


<p>The device complies with these guidelines when used against the head with no separation and body with 10 mm separation. Ensure that device accessories, such as device case and device holster, are not composed of metal components. Keep the device away from your body to meet the distance requirement.</p>


<p>For Pixel 10, the highest Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values reported are:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Head: 0.99 W/kg,</li>
  <li>Body: 0.98 W/kg.</li>
</ul>


<p>For Pixel 10 Pro, the highest Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values reported are:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Head: 0.99 W/kg,</li>
  <li>Body: 0.99 W/kg.</li>
</ul>


<p>For Pixel 10 Pro XL, the highest Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values reported are:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Head: 0.98 W/kg,</li>
  <li>Body: 0.93 W/kg.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can also see SAR values on the website of the DoT/Telecommunication Engineering Centre.</p>


<p>While most of the laboratory studies have been unable to find a direct link between exposure to radio-frequency radiation and health, the DoT has prescribed the following precautionary measures while using the mobile handset:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Use a wireless hands-free system (headphone, headset) with a lower-power Bluetooth emitter.</li>
  <li>Make sure that the mobile phone has a low SAR. Keep your calls short or send a text message (SMS) instead. This advice applies especially to children, adolescents and pregnant women.</li>
  <li>Use a mobile phone when the signal quality is good. People with active medical implants should preferably keep the mobile phone at least 15 cm away from the implant.</li>
</ul>


<p>This device supports Cell Broadcast Service (CBS) for disaster and other emergency alerts in India. You can turn alert types on or off, find past alerts and control sound and vibration.</p>


<ol>
  <li>Open your device's Settings<strong> </strong>app.</li>
  <li>Tap <strong>Notifications</strong> <img alt="and then" src="image1.png" width="18" height="18"> <strong>Wireless emergency alerts</strong>.</li>
